Took GiorgioJuan's update of Angle Snap an updated it to 1.21.11

Changes:
Decided to make angle marker settings say broken
Changed max snap angle from 10 to 40 because without markers to guide you 10 degrees is rather small
I'm sure you know how to find the latest dependencies

also this is my first time actually dealing with java code and Minecraft modding so I can guarantee that the stuff I did is almost certainly the worst way about it.
